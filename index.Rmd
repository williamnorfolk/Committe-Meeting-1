**Welcome to the William Norfolk first committee meeting website!**   

Due to the fact that COVId-19 has substantially limited our ability to meet in person, I thought it would be easier to generate a short informational website to provide some background and research updates prior to our Zoom meeting. The subsections below provide details about my program of study, dissertation research, and any additional projects I have or currently am contributing to. Note all images can be enlarged by clicking on the picture to view a lightbox.

### Abiotic tolerance characterization of _Vibrio alginolyticus_ and the implications for disease transmission.

## Summary
Anthropogenic climate change and habitat disruption have drastically altered the abiotic factors that mediate coastal ecosystems. Alterations to these abiotic factors can have cascading effects on the microbial ecology of the system and can promote the proliferation of potentially harmful bacterial species when optimal conditions are met. _Vibrio_ is a ubiquitous taxon of heterotrophic marine bacteria commonly associated with human and environmental (non-human) diseases. A highly adaptive genus, _Vibrio_ are known to respond synergistically to increases in water temperature and nutrient availability (particularly iron). Optimal growth conditions can create _Vibrio_ "blooms" and thus increase the risk of infection. _Vibrio alginolyticus_ is an emerging pathogen within the taxon known to cause human illness via wound/ear infection and environmental illness in filter feeding marine invertebrates (primarily associated with the shellfish industry). Research is needed to characterize the physiological limitations of _V. alginolyticus_ to better understand the abiotic conditions that are favorable to the development/transmission of disease. 

This work aims to characterize the viable and optimal abiotic condition levels for _V. alginolyticus_ at a range of temperature, salinity, and nutrient availability. Characterizations will be measured _in situ_ using an optical density meter to construct bacterial growth curves and illustrate changes in the growth kinetics of _V. alginolyticus_ at the given condition. The results of these characterizations will be used to develop a working model of _V. alginolyticus_ disease risk.

## Progress Thus Far
For this research, a prototype optical density meter was constructed to optimize and automate the measurement of growth kinetics. Pictured below (Fig 1), the prototype meter runs on the Arduino platform (a commercially available open source electronics prototyping board) to collect real-time growth data from a liquid bacterial culture. An LED light source (600nm) passes a beam of light through the growing sample, and the transmitted light is quantified by a detector downstream. The level of transmitted light is logarithmically related to the bacterial concentration according to Beer-Lampert's Law and can be used to quantify growth kinetics when measured over a standard growing period. 

Currently, the meter has been built and optimized for usage in the laboratory. A tangential evaluation/methods development study was conducted to test the efficacy of the meter measuring the growth of _Vibrio alginolyticus_, _Salmonella_, and _Escherichia coli_. The results of this study indicate that the prototype is a viable measurement device for bacterial optical density. Three representative growth curves generated from the meter can be viewed below (Fig 2).

#knitr::include_graphics(c("./protometer.jpg", "./protometer.jpg", "./protometer.jpg"))
```

## Upcoming Work
Following the completion of the evaluation study (tentatively beginning in August 2020), the prototype meter will be employed to measure the growth tolerance of _V. alginolyticus_ as described above. Temperature responses will be measured at 2$^\circ$ intervals from 20$^\circ$-40$^\circ$, salinity responses will be measured at 4ppt intervals from 0ppt-40ppt, and nutrient responses will be measured for minimal-enriched media (specific levels pending). Combinatory investigations of the optimal levels for each factor will also be measured to determine if additive responses are observed. From these data a semi-quantitative risk scale will be developed to classify the potential for _V. alginolyticus_ infection in relation to ambient abiotic conditions. 

Pilot results (from an earlier version of the prototype) suggest the meter is sensitive enough to record subtle differences in bacterial growth kinetics in response to changing temperatures (Fig 3).

### Foodborne transmission of _Vibrio alginolyticus_ via ingestion of colonized zooplankon.

## Summary
As naturally occurring bacteria, _Vibrio_ are frequently implicated as the causative pathogens for various marine diseases. Numerous studies have shown that _Vibrio_ spp. act a secondary pathogens infecting exposed lesions in organisms ranging from humans to corals, however, few studies have attempted to characterize the mechanistic aquisition of pathogenic _Vibro_ into healthy host organisms.

## O^3^ Disinfection

In the early stages of the first COVID-19 lockdown the Lipp Lab and Glenn Lab (EHS) were recruited to conduct a breif evaluation study testing the efficacy of ozone disinfection of personal protective equipment for the elimination of SARS CoV-2. The objective of this work was to determine if a Zono (a commerically available ozone-based disinfection cabinet) was capable of reducing the viral load of comtaminated N95 masks to facilitate reuse in hospitals or other essential facilities. Small clippings of N95 mask material were seeded with laboratory grown MS2 coliphage (a surrogate for SARS CoV-2) and exposed to standard and heavy Zono treatment. Following treatment, the clippings were eluted into beef extract and plated using a soft agar overly method to obtain direct counts of MS2 plaque forming units (PFUs). The results suggest that ozone disinfection is capable of reducing the viral load of N95 masks and could potentially be a viable option for the steralization and reuse of PPE (Fig #).

## COVID Working Group

In April I joined the Center for Infectious Disease and Ecology's (CEID) coronavirus working group to assist with the development data visualiztions for the evolving COVID-19 pandemic. To date I have contributed (and continue to update) to the design and coding of the CEID [COVID tracker](https://www.covid19.uga.edu/tracker.html). Currently I am working to develop a similar R-based shiny application for the visualization of forecast model data (to be released in the near future). 

## COVID Wastewater

Currently, the Lipp Lab is engaged in an ongoing COVID monitoring project designed to assess the population-level burden of the disease using wastewater monitoring. The objective of this research is to design and evaluate the methods for viral concntration, extraction, and quantification to determine the viral shedding patterns of Athens, GA. Wastewater influent composite samples are collected weekly from the North Oconee, Middle Oconee, and Cedar Creek water reclimation facilities, aliquotted/concentrated for viral extraction, and quantified using RT-qPCR. Thus far we have successfully developed a pipeline for the extraction and quantification of SARS CoV-2 in wastewater and intend to utilize these methods as a component of a larger Athens-based COVID study to progress over the course of the upcoming year.
