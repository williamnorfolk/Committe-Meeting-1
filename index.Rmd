**Welcome to the William Norfolk first committee meeting website!**   

Due to the fact that COVId-19 has substantially limited our ability to meet in person, I thought it would be easier to generate a short informational website to provide some background and research updates prior to our Zoom meeting. The subsections below provide details about my program of study, dissertation research, and any additional projects I have or currently am contributing to.

## Summary
### Abiotic tolerance characterization of _Vibrio alginolyticus_ and the implications for disease transmission.

Anthropogenic climate change and habitat disruption have drastically altered the abiotic factors that mediate coastal ecosystems. Alterations to these abiotic factors can have cascading effects on the microbial ecology of the system and can promote the proliferation of potentially harmful bacterial species when optimal conditions are met. _Vibrio_ is a ubiquitous taxon of heterotrophic marine bacteria commonly associated with human and environmental (non-human) diseases. A highly adaptive genus, _Vibrio_ are known to respond synergistically to increases in water temperature and nutrient availability (particularly iron). Optimal growth conditions can create _Vibrio_ "blooms" and thus increase the risk of infection. _Vibrio alginolyticus_ is an emerging pathogen within the taxon known to cause human illness via wound/ear infection and environmental illness in filter feeding marine invertebrates (primarily associated with the shellfish industry). Research is needed to characterize the physiological limitations of _V. alginolyticus_ to better understand the abiotic conditions that are favorable to the development/transmission of disease. 

This work aims to characterize the viable and optimal abiotic condition levels for _V. alginolyticus_ at a range of temperature, salinity, and nutrient availability. Characterizations will be measured _in situ_ using an optical density meter to construct bacterial growth curves and illustrate changes in the growth kinetics of _V. alginolyticus_ at the given condition. The results of these characterizations will be used to develop a working model of _V. alginolyticus_ disease risk.

## Progress Thus Far
For this research, a prototype optical density meter was constructed to optimize and automate the measurement of growth kinetics. Pictured below (Fig 1), the prototype meter runs on the Arduino platform (a commercially available open source electronics prototyping board) to collect real-time growth data from a liquid bacterial culture. An LED light source (600nm) passes a beam of light through the growing sample, and the transmitted light is quantified by a detector downstream. The level of transmitted light is logarithmically related to the bacterial concentration according to Beer-Lampert's Law and can be used to quantify growth kinetics when measured over a standard growing period. 

Currently, the meter has been built and optimized for usage in the laboratory. A tangential evaluation/methods development study was conducted to test the efficacy of the meter measuring the growth of _Vibrio alginolyticus_, _Salmonella_, and _Escherichia coli_. The results of this study indicate that the prototype is a viable measurement device for bacterial optical density. Three representative growth curves generated from the meter can be viewed below (Fig 2).

```

## Upcoming Work
Following the completion of the evaluation study, the prototype meter will be employed to measure the growth tolerance of _V. alginolyticus_ as described above. Tentatively, temperature responses will be measured from 20$^\circ$-40$^\circ$, salinity responses will be measured from 0ppt-40ppt, and nutrient responses will be measured for minimal-enriched media. Combinatory investigations of the optimal levels for each factor will also be measured to determine if additive responses are observed. From these data a semi-quantitative risk scale will be developed to classify the potential for _V. alginolyticus_ infection in relation to ambient abiotic conditions.
